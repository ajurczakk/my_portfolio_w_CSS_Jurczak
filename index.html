            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hi my name is Allie Jurczak and I am finishing my first year at Lewis University. I transferred from Moraine Valley Community College with an associates degree in IT Security. Ever since I was younger I have always been fascinated with computers and the way they work.
                My main objective once I graduate with my computer science degree is to find a job in IT Security or Cybersecurity. I'm still deciding between the two and I might even end up doing a certificate to enhance my skills, but I haven't chosen what type of certificate I want to complete.
                In my previous coding classes learning Python and C# I found coding to be tedious. I'm hoping that coding web pages will be a little easier and not as tedious as C# or Python. I'm looking forward to learning a new language and beginning my skills in HTML5.
